# Accessible `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`

Proposal for an `Object.hasOwn()` method to make `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` more accessible.

## Status

This proposal is currently at [Stage 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposals#stage-2)

## Motivation

Today, it is very common (especially in library code) to write code like:

```js
let hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty

if (hasOwnProperty.call(object, "foo")) {
  console.log("has property foo")
}
```

This proposal simplifies that code to:

```js
if (Object.hasOwn(object, "foo")) {
  console.log("has property foo")
}
```

There are a number of existing libraries which make this more convenient:

- [npm: has][npm-has]
- [npm: lodash.has][npm-lodash-has]
- [See Related](#related)

This is a common practices because methods on `Object.prototype` can sometimes be unavailable or redefined.

### `Object.create(null)`

`Object.create(null)` will create an object that does not inherit from `Object.prototype`, making those methods inaccessible.

```js
Object.create(null).hasOwnProperty("foo")
// Uncaught TypeError: Object.create(...).hasOwnProperty is not a function
```

### Redefining `hasOwnProperty`

If you do not directly own every property defined of an object, you can't be 100% certain that calling `.hasOwnProperty()` is calling the built-in method:

```js
let object = {
  hasOwnProperty() {
    throw new Error("gotcha!")
  }
}

object.hasOwnProperty("foo")
// Uncaught Error: gotcha!
```

### ESLint `no-prototype-builtins`

ESLint has a [built-in rule][eslint-no-prototype-builtins] for banning use of prototype builtins like `hasOwnProperty`.

> Examples of incorrect code for this rule:
>
> ```js
> /*eslint no-prototype-builtins: "error"*/
> var hasBarProperty = foo.hasOwnProperty("bar");
> ...
> ```
>
> Examples of correct code for this rule:
>
> ```js
> /*eslint no-prototype-builtins: "error"*/
> var hasBarProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(foo, "bar");
> ...
> ```

### MDN `hasOwnProperty()` advice

The MDN documentation for `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` includes [advice][mdn-hasownproperty-advice] not to use it off of the prototype chain directly:

> JavaScript does not protect the property name hasOwnProperty; thus, if the possibility exists that an object might have a property with this name, it is necessary to use an external hasOwnProperty to get correct results [...]

## Proposal

This proposal adds a `Object.has(object, property)` method with the same behavior as calling `hasOwnProperty.call(object, property)`

```js
let object = { foo: false }
Object.hasOwn(object, "foo") // true

let object2 = Object.create({ foo: true })
Object.hasOwn(object2, "foo") // false

let object3 = Object.create(null)
Object.hasOwn(object3, "foo") // false
```

## Implementations

There are currently no native implementations of `Object.has` in JavaScript engines.

A polyfill of `Object.hasOwn()` is available in [polyfill.js](./polyfill.js).

## Q&A

### Why not `Object.hasOwnProperty(object, property)`?

`Object.hasOwnProperty(property)` already exists today because `Object` itself inherits from `Object.prototype` so defining a new method with a different signature would be a breaking change.

### Why the name `hasOwn`?

This is actively being discussed in Stage 2, see [Issue #3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-accessible-object-hasownproperty/issues/3)

### Why not use `Map` for dictionaries instead of objects?

Excerpt from https://v8.dev/features/object-fromentries#objects-vs.-maps

> JavaScript also supports Maps, which are often a more suitable data structure than regular objects. So in code that you have full control over, you might be using maps instead of objects. However, as a developer, you do not always get to choose the representation. Sometimes the data youâ€™re operating on comes from an external API or from some library function that gives you an object instead of a map.

### Why not place this method on `Reflect`?

The purpose of `Reflect` is to contain, 1:1, a method for each `Proxy` trap. There is already a method on `Proxy` that traps `hasOwnProperty` (`getOwnPropertyDescriptor`) so it doesn't make sense to add an additional trap, therefore it doesn't make sense to place this method on `Reflect`.
